# Simple-port-Scanner

This is just a simple port scanner using Python Socket programming. It gets the hostname or IP address and the range to ports to be scanned as an input and then scans them. 
It's not designed to just scan the important ports. It might be done in later. But for now, it just scans every port in the specified range.
