# Simple-port-Scanner

This is just a simple port scanner using Python Socket programming. It gets the hostname or IP address and the range to ports to be scanned as input and then checks if they are open.
It's not designed to just scan the important ports. It might be done in later. But for now, it just scans every port in the specified range. 

# How to download

Clone the repo to your computer using git command.

# How to run it

It's just a normal python program. So you can use the "python3 <file_name>" command to run it. 
Or you can change it into an executable with "chmod +x <file_name>" and just run it with "./<file_name>".

# How to use

After running the program, enter the Hostname or IP address. After that, enter the range of ports you want to scan. If the port is open, it would give an output. If it's not, the program would just pass through it.
